## Transfer Learning Project

This README page aims to be an introduction for the ongoing transfer learning project with applications to particle physics. The project in it of itself is aimed at advancing and observing the machine learning applications to the world of particle physics, and specifically, to the task of jet-tagging. As described in the original repository for Sophon, _"...the model Sophon (Sophon (Signature-Oriented Pre-training for Heavy-resonance ObservatioN) is a method proposed for developing foundation AI models tailored for future usage in LHC experimental analyses..." _ More specifically, the Sophon is a deep learning framework developed with the goal of better classifiying jets—AKA, collimated sprays of particles produced in high-energy collisions at places like the LHC (Large Hadron Collider)—using both particle-level and jet-level features.

The bigger and more universal goal, however, is to explore representation learning in jet physics, focusing on how neuralnetowrk embeddings capture physical information across different datasets and simulation domains. By doing all of this, we are aiming for the following, overarching goal:** Evaluate transfer learning potential across deep learning models and jet types (Sophon vs. ParT & Higgs, top, QCD, etc.)**
